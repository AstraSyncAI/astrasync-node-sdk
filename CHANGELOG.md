## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-20

### ðŸŽ‰ Production Release

This marks the official production release of the AstraSync Node.js SDK!

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Updated API endpoint from Railway development environment to production (`https://astrasync.ai/api/v1`)
- Updated all documentation from "Developer Preview" to "Production"
- Removed trust score cap (was limited to 95 for preview, now supports full 100 scale)
- Updated package version to 1.0.0
- Updated all code examples to reflect production environment

### Improved
- Trust score calculations now support full 0-100 range
- Production-grade API endpoints with improved reliability
- Enhanced documentation for production use
- Full TypeScript support with type safety

### Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from v0.1.x (Developer Preview):

1. **Update your installation:**
   ```bash
   npm install --upgrade @astrasyncai/sdk
   ```

2. **No code changes required** - The SDK is backward compatible. All API calls will automatically use the new production endpoints.

3. **Agent IDs:** New registrations will receive production `ASTRAS-XXX` IDs instead of temporary `TEMP-XXX` IDs.

4. **Trust Scores:** Trust scores are now calculated on the full 0-100 scale instead of capped at 95.

### Note
- Blockchain integration remains in progress and will be fully enabled in a future release
- All existing functionality continues to work as expected
